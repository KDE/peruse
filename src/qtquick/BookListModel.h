 * handles book entries and the different categories that books can be in.
 * 
 * It also extends QQmlParseStatus to ensure that the loading the cache of
 * books is postponed until the application UI has been painted at least once.
 * 
 * BookListModel keeps track of which books there are, how they can be sorted
 * and how far the reader is in reading a specific book.
 * 
 * It caches its entries in the BookDataBase.
 * 
 * ContentModel is the model used to enable searching the collection, it is
 * typically a ContentList.
