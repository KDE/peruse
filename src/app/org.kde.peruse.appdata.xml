    <p>
      There are many ways to read comic books, and one of those that has become more
      common in recent years is on a computer. Peruse was created as a way to make
      exactly that as easy and pleasant as possible, and to simply get out of the
      way and let you read your comic books. One could say that it allows you to
      peruse your comic books at your leisure, but that would be a silly way of
      putting it - so, peruse your comic books at your leisure!
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the ways in which Peruse ensures your reading experience is as pleasant
      and effortless as possible is to allow you to simply pick up where you last left
      off. The welcome page in the application (first screenshot below) shows you your
      most recently read comics, and shows your progress through them. To pick up
      where you left off, simply tap the top left item and you will be taken right to
      the page you were reading before you had to stop.
