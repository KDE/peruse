# The Plan

1.0 version:


* Create desktop UX (mouse/keyboard focus, complementing the touch UX)
* Adding rar support to karchive (based on the The Unarchiver backend built for Ark?)
* File metadata extraction enhancements (page count support for pdf, cbr et al)
* Add search option
* Resume reading from where you left off
* Tap/click based navigation in addition to flicking, also keyboard shortcuts for navigation
* Thumbnail page selector





Future versions

* Support for downloading comics through GHNS, and perhaps extend the payment support in this so as to allow the users to get and support comics from places which publish them through OCS (and others)
* Rating (stored in baloo)
* Tags (stored in baloo)
* Viewport-based comic book view support (where metadata defines a viewport to show, rather than a full page, research required on formats and methods)
* Table of Contents for formats supporting this
* Folder based books (for comics stored as a folder of images)
