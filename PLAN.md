# The Plan

* Create desktop UX (mouse/keyboard focus, complementing the touch UX)
* File metadata extraction enhancements (page count support for pdf, cbr et al)
* Resume reading from where you left off
* Tap/click based navigation in addition to flicking, also keyboard shortcuts for navigation
* Table of Contents for formats supporting this
* Thumbnail page selector
* Folder based books (for comics stored as a folder of images)
* Viewport-based comic book view support (where metadata defines a viewport to show, rather than a full page, research required on formats and methods)
* Rating (stored in baloo)
* Tags (stored in baloo)
* Adding rar support to karchive (based on the The Unarchiver backend built for Ark?)
* Support for downloading comics through GHNS, and perhaps extend the payment support in this so as to allow the users to get and support comics from places which publish them through OCS (and others)
